I already had a solid understanding of HTML and CSS before starting this project. I was however, pretty rusty on vanilla JS and find myself having to google a few commands to get the program to run.

I wonder if there is a better way to define the win conditons of the whoWon function?

All in all, it was a fun, cute project.
